- Re-written the shadow polygon optimization, which both fixed most weird lighting box when drawing unusual shadow shapes, and drastically reduce the shadow segments numbers by roughly 10% (which lead to faster performance). 
- Re-organized the region id usage, counting from zero height so that mean now you can draw 0-height shadow caster block, or can be call as top-down-2D-block. You will need to increase the old region id by 1 though. Also now you can limited the region id block by a range instead of only start index like before (default is from 1 to 10). 
- Introduce two more special block that can be specified its id (default is 50 and 51): top-roof block and ignore-shadows block. Top-roof block serve the purpose of draw top roof, which no light can be cast on it (useful when you drawing a gate, etc.) and ignore-shadow block will NOT let any shadow ray to be cast on it (can be use when you want to make the illusion of a wall that is higher than the light ray, which the shadow cannot cast to).
- Fixed some minor bugs.
